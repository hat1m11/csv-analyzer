CSV Sales Report Analyzer ðŸš€

What's This?
Welcome to the CSV Sales Report Analyzer! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple web app built with Spring Boot that lets you upload a CSV file with sales data. The app takes that boring raw data and turns it into cool charts and graphs. ðŸ“Šâœ¨

It's perfect if you just want to quickly see your sales trends and get some insights from your data. Keep it simple, keep it fun! ðŸ˜Ž

Features ðŸŒŸ
- Upload Your CSV: Drop your CSV file with sales data into the app.
- Data Magic: The app reads your CSV, figures out the sales and years, and processes them.
- Visualize It: See your data come to life with line charts, bar charts, and pie charts! ðŸ“ˆ

Technologies Used ðŸ’»
- Java with Spring Boot: Powers the backend and does the heavy lifting.
- Apache Commons CSV: For reading and parsing CSV files.
- JavaScript & Chart.js: For drawing beautiful charts and graphs.
- CSS: To make everything look snazzy! âœ¨

How It Works
1. Upload a CSV: Upload your CSV file with sales data (Year and Sales columns required).
2. Magic Happens: The app reads your file and processes the data.
3. Boom!: Youâ€™ll see your data in the form of charts and graphs, ready to wow your friends or impress your boss! ðŸ’¼

Example CSV Format ðŸ“„:
Make sure your CSV looks like this (with at least "Year" and "Sales" columns):

Year,Sales 
2020,1500 
2021,1800 
2022,2100...


## Limitations (I Will Improve It Later!) ðŸš§
Right now, the app only handles simple sales data (Year and Sales columns).
The charts are basic, but weâ€™ll add more features and fancy charts soon!
Itâ€™s all about keeping it simple and fun, for now! ðŸŽ‰

(Use the sample_data.csv in the files of the repo!)
